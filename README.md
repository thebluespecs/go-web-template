# go-web-template
Just a starter project for golang

## Libraries
The project uses `zap` as a logging library. It also uses `fiber` as the web framework of choice.
The project also uses `godotenv` for loading config of the env

## Build System
The project uses `make` as the build system.

## The Structure
The structure is solely my choice and how I prefer it. This is can vary for you.

## Github actions
The github actions are setup in a way to always run build and tests when a PR is raised or a merge happens to main.
